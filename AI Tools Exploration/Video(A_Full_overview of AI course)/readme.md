## Video Creation

**Tool Used**: InVideo (for video generation and AI voiceover)

**Steps to Create the Video**:

1. **Scripting**  
   - Used ChatGPT with a specific prompt to generate an extended script.  
   - The script covers the theoretical aspects of the AI course, referencing key chapters from *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (AI, Agents, Search Algorithms, Adversarial Search, Game-Playing Agents).  
   - It also details the practical lab tasks, including implementing and testing algorithms (Min-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning, A*, AO Heuristic, AO*, DFS, BFS) using classic games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, final pebble).  
   - The script mentions the use of various AI tools (Google Colab, ChatGPT, RunwayML, Pika Labs, VEED.io, DiagramGPT, Figma AI, Lucidchart) in the context of the course.  


   **Extended Script Excerpt**:  
   > Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a futuristic conceptâ€”itâ€™s a practical field with deep roots in logic, mathematics, and computer science. In this course, we take a complete approachâ€”combining theory, practical implementation, and modern AI tools to truly understand and build intelligent systems.  
   > â€¦  
   > Youâ€™re not just learning how AI worksâ€”youâ€™re using AI to build it. And thatâ€™s what makes this course unique.

2. **Voiceover**  
   - Utilized InVideo's built-in AI voiceover feature to generate a natural-sounding male narration directly from the script.

3. **Video Generation**  
   - Uploaded the complete script and selected the AI voiceover within the InVideo platform.  
   - The tool automatically generated the video, including visuals and text overlays, based on the script content.  
   - The final video duration was over 1 minute.
