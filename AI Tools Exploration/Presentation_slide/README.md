## Presentation Slide Creation

**Tools Used**:  
- Slidesgo (template & design): https://slidesgo.com/  
- ChatGPT (content & script generation): https://chat.openai.com/  

**Steps to Create the Slides**  
1. **Template Selection**  
   - Chose a modern, AI/tech-themed template with 10–12 slides from Slidesgo’s library.  
2. **Scripting & Content Outline**  
   - Used a ChatGPT prompt to generate detailed bullet points for each slide, e.g.:  
     > “Create a 10-slide outline covering the AI course’s theory (agents, search, games) and lab tasks (algorithm implementations in Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Connect Four). Include tools and real-world examples.”  
   - Refined the ChatGPT output to match the course flow and learning objectives.  
3. **Customization in Slidesgo**  
   - Pasted the ChatGPT‐generated text into each slide’s placeholders.  
   - Adjusted colors, icons, diagrams, and fonts to align with the AI course branding.  
4. **Export**  
   - Downloaded the final deck as a PPTX file ready for presentation.
