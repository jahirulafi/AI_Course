# AI Tools Exploration

This folder contains two AI-powered deliverables that summarize our AI course—combining theory (textbook chapters, core concepts) and lab tasks (algorithms & games):

- **Video**: A 1+ minute overview narrated and animated with AI tools.  
- **Presentation**: A 10–12-slide deck detailing course topics and hands-on exercises.

## 1. Video Creation

**Tool Used**  
- InVideo (video generation + AI voiceover)

**Steps**  
1. **Scripting**  
   - Used ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) with a custom prompt to produce an extended script.  
   - Covered:
     - Core theory from *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (Agents, Search Algorithms, Adversarial Search, Game-Playing Agents)  
     - Lab implementations of Min-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning, A*, AO*, DFS, BFS in Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess & Connect Four  
     - AI tools leveraged: Google Colab, ChatGPT, RunwayML, Pika Labs, VEED.io, DiagramGPT, Figma AI, Lucidchart  
   - **Excerpt**:  
     > “Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a futuristic concept—it’s a practical field … You’re not just learning how AI works—you’re using AI to build it.”

2. **Voiceover**  
   - Generated a natural-sounding male narration using InVideo’s built-in AI voiceover.

3. **Video Generation**  
   - Uploaded script + voiceover to InVideo.

   - Picked a 10–12-slide AI/tech template from Slidesgo’s library.

2. **Content Scripting**  
   - Prompted ChatGPT to generate a detailed slide outline:
     > “Create a 10-slide deck covering the AI course theory (agents, search, games) and lab tasks (algorithm implementations in Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Connect Four). Include tools and real-world examples.”  
   - Edited and refined ChatGPT’s output to match the course flow.

3. **Customization in Slidesgo**  
   - Pasted ChatGPT-generated text into slide placeholders.  
   - Adjusted color schemes, icons, and diagrams to reflect the AI course branding.
