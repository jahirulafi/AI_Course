# Minimax Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used for decision making in games like chess, checkers, and other two-player games. It considers the current state of the game and the possible moves from that state, evaluating the best move by considering the opponent's possible responses.

## How it Works

1.  **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with the current state of the game.
2.  **Evaluation**: The algorithm evaluates the current state and determines if it's a winning, losing, or neutral state.
3.  **Recursion**: The algorithm recursively explores all possible moves from the current state, considering the opponent's possible responses.

## Code Structure

### Functions

1.  `minimax(node, depth, path)`:
    *   Recursively traverses the game tree and applies the Minimax algorithm.
    *   `node`: The current node name in the game tree.
    *   `depth`: Current depth in the tree (used to alternate between maximizer and minimizer).
    *   `path`: Tracks the sequence of nodes explored during decision making.
    *   Returns the best value at the current node along with the decision path.

## Sample Execution

This example uses a **custom game tree** built from user input.  
Each node can have any number of children, and leaf nodes contain utility values.
### Explanation

*   The algorithm evaluates the game tree and determines the best value the maximizing player can guarantee.

## Complexity

*   **Time Complexity**: O(b^d), where b is the branching factor, and d is the depth of the tree.
*   **Space Complexity**: O(d), as the algorithm needs to store the nodes at each level.

## Applications

1.  **Game Playing**: The Minimax algorithm is widely used in game-playing AI, such as chess, checkers, and other two-player games.
2.  **Decision Making**: It is used in decision-making systems to evaluate the best course of action.

## Advantages

1.  **Optimality**: The Minimax algorithm guarantees finding the optimal solution if the evaluation function is accurate.
2.  **Efficiency**: It is more efficient than exhaustive search algorithms for large game trees.

## Disadvantages

1.  **Complexity**: Implementing the Minimax algorithm can be complex, especially for large game trees.
2.  **Evaluation Function**: The performance of the Minimax algorithm depends on the quality of the evaluation function.
