# ðŸª¨ **The Final Pebble (Minimax AI Game)**

A strategic stone-removal game built in **Python (Tkinter GUI)**, where you play against an **AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm**.  
Both you and the AI take turns removing stones â€” the player who takes the **last stone wins!**

---

## **i. How to Run Your File**

### **Navigate to the Game Folder**
```bash
cd AI-Course/AI_Games/The_Final_Pebble
```

### **Run the Game**
Execute the Python script:
```bash
python final_pebble.py
```

---

## **ii. Software/Library/Framework Requirements**

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher  
- **Tkinter**: Comes pre-installed with Python (no need to install separately)  

Optional (for better emoji rendering on some systems):  
- **Windows Terminal or UTF-8 enabled console**

---

## **iii. How to Play the Game**

### ðŸŽ® **Start the Game**
Run the script as described above.  
A simple and clean GUI will open showing a pile of stones.

### **Gameplay Rules**
- The game starts with **20â€“30 stones** (randomly chosen each round).  
- On your turn, you can take **1, 2, or 3 stones** from the pile by pressing the corresponding button.  
- After your move, the **AI (computer)** will automatically make its move.  
- The player who **takes the last stone wins**.

### **Buttons**
- **Take 1 / Take 2 / Take 3:** Removes the selected number of stones.  
- **New Game:** Automatically appears after each round ends.

## **v. Algorithm Used**

The AI in this game uses the **Minimax Algorithm**, which is a common decision-making algorithm used in turn-based games.

### ðŸ§  **How the Algorithm Works:**
1. **Player (Human)** â†’ Tries to *maximize* their chance of winning.  
2. **AI (Computer)** â†’ Tries to *minimize* the playerâ€™s chances.  
3. The AI simulates all possible outcomes for the next few turns and chooses the move that guarantees the best final result (win or block playerâ€™s win).  

---

### **Key Functions**
- `minimax(stones, maximizing)`: Recursively checks all possible moves and returns the optimal score.  
- `ai_move()`: Uses the Minimax function to determine the best move (taking 1â€“3 stones).  
- `player_take(x)`: Handles playerâ€™s turn and checks if the player has won.  
- `update()`: Updates the stone count and display in the GUI.
