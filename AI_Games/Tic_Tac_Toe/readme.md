# **Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI**

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using Tkinter, where you can play against an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.

---

## **i. How to Run the Game**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### **Run the Game**
1. Navigate to the game folder:

         cd AI-Course/AI_Games/TicTacToe


2. Execute the Python script:

         python tic_tac_toe.py


---

## **ii. Software Requirements**

- **Python**: Version 3.x or higher
- **Tkinter**: Comes pre-installed with Python (no additional installation needed)

---

## **iii. How to Play the Game**

### **Game Setup**
- You play as **X**
- The computer plays as **O**
- The game starts with an empty 3Ã—3 grid

### **Game Controls**
- Click on any empty square to place your **X**
- The computer will automatically respond with its **O** move
- The game alternates turns until there's a winner or draw

### **Game Rules**
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw

### **Game Outcomes**
- **You win**: When you get 3 X's in a row
- **Computer wins**: When the computer gets 3 O's in a row
- **Draw**: When all squares are filled with no winner

After each game, a message box will appear showing the result, and the board will reset automatically.

## **v. Algorithm Used**

The AI opponent uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to make optimal moves.

### **How Minimax Works**:
- **Maximizing Player (Computer)**: Tries to maximize its score (find winning moves)
- **Minimizing Player (Human)**: Tries to minimize the computer's score (block winning moves)
- **Recursive Evaluation**: The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and counter-moves
- **Scoring System**:
  - Computer win: +1
  - Player win: -1
  - Draw: 0

### **Key Functions**:
- `minimax(depth, is_maximizing)`: The core algorithm that evaluates board positions
- `computer_move()`: Determines the best move for the computer
- `check_winner(player)`: Checks if the specified player has won
- `available_moves()`: Returns list of available moves on the board

### **AI Behavior**:
- The computer will always make the optimal move
- It will never lose (can only win or draw)
- Uses depth-first search to evaluate all possible game states
